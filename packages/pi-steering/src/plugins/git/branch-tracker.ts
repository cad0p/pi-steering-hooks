/**
 * `branch` tracker for the git plugin.
 *
 * Models the effective git branch AT EACH extracted command within a
 * single `tool_call`. The motivating case is the ADR's
 * `git checkout A && git commit` example: a session-level
 * "current branch" query would miss the mid-command checkout and allow
 * the commit on what looks like a non-protected branch. A walker-backed
 * tracker folds the `git checkout` delta into the branch value seen by
 * the subsequent `git commit`, so a rule gated on
 * `when: { branch: /^main$/ }` correctly fires if the chain ends up on
 * `main`.
 *
 * Semantics:
 *   - `git checkout X`  - sequential; branch becomes `X` for the rest
 *     of this scope.
 *   - `git switch X`    - sequential; same as above.
 *   - `git checkout -b NEW` / `git switch -c NEW` - sequential; branch
 *     becomes `NEW`. The `-b` / `-c` token is consumed; the following
 *     argument is the new branch name.
 *   - Anything else under `git` (including `git commit`, `git status`,
 *     `git checkout -- FILE`) leaves the branch unchanged. Returning
 *     `current` (not `undefined`) is important: a `git commit` that
 *     happens to carry a non-static arg (e.g. `-m "$MSG"`) must NOT
 *     collapse branch state to `unknown`.
 *   - Non-static branch names (`git checkout $BR`, `git checkout "$BR"`)
 *     return `undefined`, which the walker translates to the tracker's
 *     `unknown` sentinel. Predicates then apply their `onUnknown`
 *     policy (default `"block"` - see the `branch` predicate handler).
 *
 * Subshells: `isolated` - a `(git checkout X)` inside parens cannot
 * change the enclosing shell's branch (real git semantics - the
 * subshell has no effect on the parent's working tree state for this
 * dimension).
 *
 * The tracker distinguishes two "I don't know the branch" states so
 * predicates can apply the correct policy:
 *
 *   - `initial: NO_CHECKOUT_IN_CHAIN` - no branch-changing modifier
 *     has fired in this ref's scope. The plugin cannot synchronously
 *     know the session's current branch at construction time; the
 *     `branch` predicate handler shells out via `ctx.exec("git",
 *     ["branch", "--show-current"])` to learn it. (A session-start
 *     prefetch is a reasonable future optimization but out of scope
 *     here.)
 *   - `unknown: "unknown"` - a modifier FIRED but couldn't resolve
 *     statically (e.g. `git checkout $VAR`). The predicate must NOT
 *     shell out in this case: `git branch --show-current` would
 *     return the PRE-checkout branch and silently defeat the
 *     walker's tracking. Predicates apply their `onUnknown` policy
 *     instead (default `"block"` -> fail-closed).
 *
 * The `NO_CHECKOUT_IN_CHAIN` sentinel is chosen to be a string that
 * cannot occur as a real git branch name (git refuses refs containing
 * `:`). Exported so tests and plugin authors can reference it; it
 * should never be constructed ad-hoc.
 *
 * ## Note for plugin authors
 *
 * This tracker is a canonical example of the strict Tracker contract -
 * unresolvable modifier targets return `undefined`, NOT `current`. The
 * built-in `cwdTracker.cd` modifier is a documented Phase-1 exception;
 * do not copy its "return current" shortcut in new trackers.

 *
 * Pre-subcommand flags are skipped before we look at the subcommand
