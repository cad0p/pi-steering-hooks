/**
 * Shared observer-merge helper used by both the evaluator's reverse
 * index (chain-aware `when.happened`) and the observer-dispatcher's
 * fire list.
 *
 * Both callers need the same answer to the question "what observers
 * does this config have, after resolving plugins and applying user
 * overrides?" Keeping a single implementation here prevents silent
 * drift — if the dispatcher drops a plugin observer because a user
 * observer shadows it by name, the evaluator's reverse-index must do
 * the same, or chain-aware speculative allow can grant on a watch
 * pattern that will never actually fire.
 *
 * Merge semantics (must match `buildObserverDispatcher`):
 *   1. User observers come first (user-wins on name collision).
 *   2. Plugin observers fill in any names not already seen.
 *
 * The order mirrors the rule-list "user overrides plugin by declaring
 * their own" pattern documented on `buildObserverDispatcher`.
