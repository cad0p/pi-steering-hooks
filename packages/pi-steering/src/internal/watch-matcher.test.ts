/**
 * Parity regression test for the shared observer-watch filter
 * contract.
 *
 * Two consumers need the same answer to "would this observer fire on
 * a successful bash tool_result with command=X?":
 *
 *   1. The production dispatcher ({@link matchesWatch} applied to a
 *      real `ToolResultEvent` arriving from pi).
 *   2. The evaluator's chain-aware `when.happened` speculative-allow
 *      (synthesizes a minimal successful bash event from a prior
 *      `&&` ref and calls {@link matchesWatch}).
 *
 * Before commit 12, path 2 hand-rolled a SUBSET of the filter. Three
 * reviewer-caught bugs (reachability aside) were all "drift between
 * the hand-rolled subset and the dispatcher's real filter":
 *
 *   - medium-001: exitCode / toolName checks missing in the subset.
 *   - FIND-3: dedup missing (not a filter drift, fixed separately).
 *   - future-drift: any new `watch` field would need parallel updates.
 *
 * Commit 12 collapsed path 2 onto {@link matchesWatch} via a
 * synthesized event. This test pins that the two paths agree on every
 * combination of `watch` field against representative ref-text inputs.
 * If a future commit adds a new `watch` field to {@link matchesWatch}
 * and forgets to exercise it in the synthesized event, the mismatch
 * shows up here first.
 *
 * Semantic layer note: chain-aware speculative-allow ALSO layers an
 * extra "observer must declare `inputMatches.command`" gate on top of
 * the shared filter (to prevent allow on command-agnostic watches —
 * not a filter-semantic question, but a chain-aware safety
 * requirement). That gate is covered end-to-end in the evaluator tests
 * ("observer without inputMatches.command → no speculative allow"). It
 * is intentionally OUT OF SCOPE here: this file verifies that when
 * both paths see the same event + watch, they compute the same filter
 * answer.
