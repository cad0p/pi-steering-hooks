/**
 * `push-requires-tests` — example rule.
 *
 * Demonstrates three v0.1.0 engine features in one rule:
 *
 *   1. Observer → rule coupling via shared constants (ADR §5, §14).
 *      `npm-test-tracker` writes `TEST_PASSED_EVENT` on every
 *      successful `npm test`; this rule gates `git push` on
 *      `when.happened`, which fires when the event has NOT happened.
 *
 *   2. Temporal invalidation via `since` (PR §4). A separate observer
 *      `retest-required-tracker` writes `RETEST_REQUIRED_EVENT` on
 *      every `git pull`. Even if tests passed earlier in the loop, a
 *      subsequent pull stale-s the test state — the rule fires again,
 *      forcing a re-run against the updated tree.
 *
 *   3. Chain-aware speculative allow (PR §4). Because the engine
 *      sees `npm-test-tracker`'s `writes: [TEST_PASSED_EVENT]`, it
 *      treats `npm test && git push` as safe: the push is gated on
 *      the prior `&&` ref, and `&&` short-circuits on test failure.
 *      This breaks the "block → agent retries same chain → block"
 *      loop without weakening the guardrail for non-chained pushes.
 *
 * `in: "agent_loop"` scopes everything to the current user prompt +
 * its tool calls. Running tests in a prior agent loop doesn't let
 * you push in this one.
 *
 * Override: disallowed. Pushing without proof of green tests is an
 * inherent-risk action here.
