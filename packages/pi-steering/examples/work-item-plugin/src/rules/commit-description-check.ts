 * `commit-description-check` — self-marking reminder rule.
 *
 * Demonstrates `Rule.onFire` + self-marking (ADR §6, §14):
 *
 *   - Pattern `/^git\s+commit\b/` matches any commit command.
 *   - `when.happened: { event: DESCRIPTION_REVIEWED_EVENT, in: "agent_loop" }`
 *     fires when the reminder entry has NOT been written this loop.
 *   - `onFire: markDescriptionReviewed` writes that entry when the
 *     rule blocks. First commit per agent loop → blocks with the
 *     reminder, self-marks. Second commit in the same loop → the
 *     entry is now present, `when.happened` no longer fires, commit
 *     is allowed.
 *
 * ## Encapsulation (ADR §14)
 *
 * No corresponding observer ships the `DESCRIPTION_REVIEWED_EVENT`
 * event — the rule is the producer and the consumer. The convention
 * for that case is: the constant + helper live IN THE RULE FILE
 * itself. Observer files own their constants; self-marking rule
 * files own theirs.
 *
 * Override: allowed. Skipping the reminder is a workflow choice.
