 *   1. Walker-unknown cwd → reason text contains
 *      `walkerUnknownCwdReason`'s anchor ("current directory:") AND
 *      the example's appended retry guidance ("literal path"
 *      reference is in the helper, "package directory" is in the
 *      append).
 *   2. Walker-known cwd → reason text is the static "uncommitted
 *      changes" message.
 *
 * Also smoke-test the config shape (registered rule, bash/command,
 * non-empty reason callable). The third branch (walker-known + clean
 * tree → no fire) is a property of `gitPlugin.isClean`'s predicate,
 * not of this rule's ReasonFn — out of scope for the reason-text
 * pinning above.
