/**
 * Predicate context construction for the v2 evaluator.
 *
 * Two concerns live here because they collaborate tightly:
 *
 *   1. `createExecCache` — memoizes `exec(cmd, args, opts)` by
 *      `(cmd, args, cwd)` so every rule evaluated for ONE tool_call
 *      sees the same result for the same query, without re-running the
 *      underlying child process. A fresh cache is created per
 *      tool_call; cross-call results are never shared.
 *   2. `createFindEntries` — wraps pi's `sessionManager.getEntries()`
 *      into the {@link PredicateContext.findEntries} shape, filtering
 *      to `type: "custom"` entries by `customType` and flattening to
 *      `{ data, timestamp }` (timestamps normalized from ISO strings to
 *      epoch ms, matching what observers producing entries can rely on).
 *
 * The evaluator itself assembles the final {@link PredicateContext}
 * from these closures plus per-candidate fields (cwd / tool / input /
 * agentLoopIndex) as an object literal — no helper needed once the shape
 * is shared across bash and write/edit code paths.
 *
 * Kept internal (under `evaluator-internals/`) so consumers can swap
 * the evaluator without inheriting its helper surface. The only
 * re-export is through `../evaluator.ts`.

/**
 * Adapt pi's `sessionManager.getEntries()` into the typed-and-filtered
 * view predicates (and observers) expect.
 *
 * Strategy:
 *   - pick only `type: "custom"` entries (the shape `pi.appendEntry`
 *     produces — see `CustomEntry` in pi's session-manager),
 *   - filter by `customType`,
 *   - project to `{ data, timestamp }` where `timestamp` is epoch-ms
 *     (parsed from the entry's ISO string). Epoch-ms is what turn-state
 *     checks want for chronological comparisons without having to
 *     re-parse.
 *
 * Results are memoized PER invocation of `createFindEntries` by
 * customType. The evaluator rebuilds the closure on every tool_call;
 * the observer dispatcher rebuilds on every tool_result. So each phase
 * sees a consistent snapshot across reads.
 *
 * Cross-rule write visibility (S2/E1): when the same phase also uses
 * a paired {@link createAppendEntry} with the SAME cache map, a write
 * during rule A's `onFire` invalidates the cached read for that
 * customType so rule B's `when.happened` predicate sees the fresh
 * entry. Callers that want this consistency pass in a shared cache
 * via the optional `cache` parameter; callers that omit it get the
 * old per-closure snapshot behaviour (pre-S2), which is sound only
 * when the closure never interleaves reads with writes.
 *
 * The `ctx` argument is the pi `ExtensionContext` — we re-read
 * `getEntries()` only on a cache miss. Cache keys are per-closure (or
 * per shared cache) so cross-tool_call or cross-tool_result reads
 * always see the freshest state (a new closure = a new cache).
