/**
 * `npm-test-tracker` — example observer.
 *
 * Watches `bash` tool_results where the command matches `/^npm test/`
 * with `exitCode: "success"`. On match, records a `TEST_PASSED_EVENT`
 * session entry so rules can later consult whether tests have passed
 * this agent loop.
 *
 * ## What this file demonstrates (ADR §14)
 *
 * The canonical observer encapsulation convention — every observer
 * file exports three things:
 *
 *   1. A `<EVENT>_EVENT` constant (the session-entry event type).
 *   2. A `mark<Event>` helper that calls `ctx.appendEntry(<TYPE>)`
 *      with the right shape.
 *   3. The observer itself, using the helper.
 *
 * Rules that gate on this event import `TEST_PASSED_EVENT` (not the
 * raw string) and/or call `markTestPassed` from their own `onFire`.
 * The raw string literal lives in exactly one place — here — and
 * downstream typos become compile errors.
 */
